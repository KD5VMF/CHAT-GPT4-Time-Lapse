To run this Python program, you'll need the following packages:

1. OpenCV: This is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

2. NumPy: This is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Here are the steps to install these packages using Anaconda:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt. You can do this by searching for "Anaconda Prompt" in your system's search bar.

2. Install the packages by typing the following commands and pressing Enter after each one:

   - To install OpenCV: 
     ```
     conda install -c conda-forge opencv
     ```
   - To install NumPy:
     ```
     conda install numpy
     ```

The `-c conda-forge` option tells Conda to install the packages from the conda-forge channel, which is a community-led collection of packages. It's often more up to date than the default channel.

Other than these, your Python environment should already have the other libraries used in this program (`time`, `datetime`, and `os`) as they are part of Python's standard library.

Please note that using OpenCV to interact with a webcam may not work on some cloud-based environments (like Google Colab or Jupyter notebook run through a cloud service), so ensure that you are running this on your local machine.
